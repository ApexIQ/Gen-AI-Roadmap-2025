# 📘 **Phase 7: Specialization & Capstone Projects**  

## 🎯 **Objective:**  
Apply your GenAI knowledge in a real-world, production-grade project tailored to your domain of interest. Learn how to integrate GenAI models into full-stack systems, explore ongoing research trends, and publish meaningful, portfolio-worthy work.

## 🔍 **Curriculum Breakdown**
---

### 🏥 **1. Domain-Specific Applications**

#### 📌 1.1 Healthcare
- Medical document summarization & Q&A
- Chest X-ray or pathology image classification using CNNs or Vision Transformers
- Conversational agents for clinical guidance (with RAG + safety layers)

#### 📌 1.2 Finance
- Market summarization using LLMs
- Fraud detection using anomaly detection or ML classification
- Risk assessment using probabilistic modeling and embeddings

#### 📌 1.3 Education
- Personalized tutors powered by GenAI (context-aware Q&A + curriculum adaptation)
- AI-powered content creators for quizzes, flashcards, and feedback

#### 📌 1.4 Entertainment
- Story, plot, or script generation using fine-tuned LLMs
- AI music generation (AudioCraft, MusicGen)
- Game design assistants or NPC behavior generators

📌 **Exercise**: Select one vertical and ideate 2–3 project concepts using GenAI

---

### 🧱 **2. Full-Stack GenAI Systems**

#### 📌 2.1 System Design
- Combine UI (Streamlit, React) + API (FastAPI, Flask) + model backend (transformer, RAG, agent)
- Consider user interaction, context memory, personalization

#### 📌 2.2 Real-Time Interfaces
- Use Gradio or Streamlit for fast prototyping
- Create chatbots, co-pilots, editors with live inputs/outputs

#### 📌 2.3 Tool Integration
- Use LangChain/LlamaIndex for document querying
- Add plug-ins: calculators, file uploaders, speech-to-text

📌 **Mini Project**: Design a wireframe + architecture diagram for your GenAI system

### ⚙️ **3. MLOps in Production**

#### 📌 3.1 Building Pipelines
- Automate data ingestion → preprocessing → model prediction → logging
- Use `MLflow` for versioning and model registry

#### 📌 3.2 Lifecycle Management
- Add logging, monitoring (W&B, Prometheus)
- Retraining triggers via data drift or feedback loops

#### 📌 3.3 Deployment Options
- Deploy via:
  - Cloud (AWS/GCP/Vertex)
  - Hugging Face Spaces
  - Local on-prem (Docker/Kubernetes)

📌 **Activity**: Write a YAML config for your model + deploy a test version using Docker or Streamlit Cloud

---

### 🔬 **4. Research & Innovation**

#### 📌 4.1 Staying Current
- Follow state-of-the-art models: **Gemini**, **GPT-4V**, **Claude**, **LLaMA 3**
- Track changes via model cards, benchmarks, and releases

#### 📌 4.2 Paper Exploration & Prototyping
- Use **Papers with Code**, **arXiv**, **Semantic Scholar** to review breakthroughs
- Reproduce key components of a published model (or reimplement with open weights)

📌 **Challenge**: Choose a recent paper and replicate a simplified version using open-source resources

---

### 🧪 **5. Capstone Project Development**

> 🎓 *Goal:* Deliver a fully functional, documented GenAI application or toolkit

#### 📌 Steps:
- Identify a real-world problem or domain-specific use case
- Perform domain research and define success criteria
- Design the app architecture (frontend, backend, model)
- Choose between a hosted LLM (e.g., OpenAI) or fine-tuned local model
- Build RAG, tool-use, or prompt chains as needed
- Deploy and test in a user-simulated or live environment
- Collect feedback and iterate

📌 **Deliverables**:
- GitHub repo with full codebase and README
- Live app/demo (HF Spaces, Streamlit, Docker URL)
- Optional: project video, technical blog, or presentation deck

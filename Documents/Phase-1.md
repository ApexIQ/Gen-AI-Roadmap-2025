# **ðŸ§  Phase 1: Python Programming & Tools**
*(Detailed version for curriculum / training manual)*

## **ðŸ“˜ Phase Overview**

This phase lays the groundwork for everything you'll build in the field of Generative AI. Python is the de facto language for AI/ML, and mastering it â€” alongside tools like Git, Jupyter, and Conda â€” is essential.

Youâ€™ll start by learning to write clean, efficient Python code, manipulate data using essential libraries, and set up a modern development environment. You'll also gain foundational knowledge in version control and working with cloud-based notebooks for experimentation.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives**

By the end of this phase, you will be able to:
- Understand and write Python programs using functions, loops, and conditionals
- Use object-oriented programming to structure code
- Work with data using NumPy and Pandas
- Visualize datasets using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Set up and use Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, and VSCode
- Track and manage code with Git and GitHub
- Use virtual environments to manage dependencies

## **ðŸ§© Module Breakdown**
---

#### **1. Python Fundamentals (Core Language)**
- Basic syntax, indentation, variables, and data types
  - `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`), `range`, `enumerate`
- Functions and parameters, return statements
- Lambda expressions and list comprehensions
- File I/O and working with `.txt`, `.csv`
- Exception handling: `try`, `except`, `finally`
- Coding style: PEP8, commenting, naming conventions

ðŸ“Œ **Hands-On Labs**:
- Number guessing game
- Build a simple file parser
- Create a modular utility script

---

#### **2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- What is OOP and why it matters in scalable codebases
- Creating classes, methods, and objects
- `__init__`, `self`, class vs instance variables
- Inheritance, method overriding
- Composition and encapsulation

ðŸ“Œ **Hands-On Labs**:
- Create a class-based Bank Account system
- Implement an Inventory Manager (OOP style)

---

#### **3. Python for Data Manipulation**
- **NumPy**:
  - Creating arrays, broadcasting
  - Slicing, indexing, reshaping arrays
  - Mathematical and statistical functions
- **Pandas**:
  - Series vs DataFrames
  - Reading/writing CSV, Excel, JSON files
  - Handling missing values, filtering, grouping, merging datasets

ðŸ“Œ **Mini Project**:
- Analyze and clean a real-world dataset (e.g., Netflix or COVID-19)

---

#### **4. Data Visualization**
- **Matplotlib**:
  - Line plots, bar plots, scatter plots
  - Plot customization: labels, legends, color maps
- **Seaborn**:
  - Distribution plots, pair plots, heatmaps
  - Working with categorical and continuous data

ðŸ“Œ **Mini Project**:
- Visualize trends in historical stock prices
- Create a dashboard of customer behavior

---

#### **5. Working with Notebooks and IDEs**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**:
  - Markdown cells, magic commands, exporting notebooks
- **Google Colab**:
  - GPU/TPU support, sharing, connecting to GitHub
- **VSCode / PyCharm**:
  - Running `.py` files, integrated terminal, extensions for Python

---

#### **6. Version Control with Git & GitHub**
- Why version control matters in AI workflows
- Git basics:
  - `init`, `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `status`, `log`
- Working with branches
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Creating pull requests
- Best practices for commits and collaboration

ðŸ“Œ **Mini Project**:
- Create a GitHub repo, push your first project
- Collaborate on a shared notebook

---

#### **7. Virtual Environments & Package Management**
- Virtual environments: `venv`, `conda`
- Activating/deactivating environments
- Using `pip` to install packages
- Managing dependencies with `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`

ðŸ“Œ **Exercise**:
- Create an isolated environment for your Python project
- Share your setup via GitHub

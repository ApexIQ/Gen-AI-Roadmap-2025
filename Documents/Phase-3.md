# 📘 **Phase 3: MLOps & Deployment**  

## 🎯 **Objective:**
Equip learners with the tools and practices needed to manage, deploy, monitor, and scale machine learning models reliably and reproducibly — aligning software engineering best practices with AI workflows.


## 🔍 **Curriculum Breakdown**
---

### 🏗️ **1. MLOps Foundations**

#### 📌 1.1 What is MLOps?
- Applying DevOps principles (automation, versioning, monitoring) to ML workflows
- Collaboration across data scientists, ML engineers, and DevOps teams
- Reproducibility, scalability, and governance as key goals

#### 📌 1.2 The ML Lifecycle
- **Development**: data cleaning, feature engineering, model training
- **Validation**: evaluation metrics, cross-validation, testing
- **Deployment**: serving model predictions via APIs
- **Monitoring**: track model performance, detect drift, trigger retraining

🧠 *Discussion:* Compare traditional software pipelines with ML pipelines and identify key challenges (e.g., data dependency, model versioning)

### 🧪 **2. Experiment Tracking & Versioning**

#### 📌 2.1 Why Experiment Tracking?
- Keeping track of model runs, parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- Collaborating on reproducible experiments

#### 📌 2.2 Tools:
- **MLflow**: tracking experiments, saving models, parameter logging
- **Weights & Biases (W&B)**: advanced dashboards, artifact versioning
- **TensorBoard**: visualize training loss, metrics, graphs

📌 **Exercise**:
- Train a model with `MLflow` and `W&B` tracking
- Visualize model training loss, ROC, and parameters

#### 📌 2.3 Run Comparisons & Reproducibility
- Compare multiple experiment runs
- Save run artifacts for rollback and auditing
- Use tags and version control with Git + ML metadata

### 🌐 **3. Model Deployment Strategies**

#### 📌 3.1 REST API Deployments
- Serve models using **FastAPI** or **Flask**
- Create endpoints for `predict()`, `healthcheck()`
- Testing with Postman / `curl` / Python requests

#### 📌 3.2 Interactive ML Apps
- Use **Streamlit** or **Gradio** for quick, intuitive interfaces
- Upload CSV, get predictions, view visualizations
- Share apps publicly via Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud

#### 📌 3.3 Deployment Targets
- **Cloud**: AWS (SageMaker, EC2), GCP (Vertex AI), Azure
- **On-prem**: deploy via internal infrastructure
- **Edge**: convert models to ONNX/TFLite for mobile/IoT devices

📌 **Mini Project**: Deploy a classifier using Streamlit and expose a REST API with FastAPI

---

### 🔁 **4. CI/CD for Machine Learning**

#### 📌 4.1 Why CI/CD for ML?
- Automate repetitive ML tasks: training, testing, retraining
- Ensure consistent performance across versions and environments

#### 📌 4.2 Tools:
- **GitHub Actions**: automate workflows triggered by commits
- **DVC (Data Version Control)**: version datasets and pipelines
- **Jenkins**, **MLflow Pipelines**: for larger pipelines and teams

📌 **Exercise**:
- Set up a GitHub Action to train and log a model on each push

---

### 📉 **5. Monitoring & Logging**

#### 📌 5.1 Post-deployment Monitoring
- **Model drift**: distributional changes in input data
- **Data quality**: nulls, outliers in production vs. training
- **Performance decay**: AUC/F1 drop over time

#### 📌 5.2 Logging & Alerting
- Use **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor metrics
- Log inputs/outputs for auditing and traceability
- Set thresholds and alerts (email, Slack, dashboards)

#### 📌 5.3 Human-in-the-loop Feedback
- Enable user correction and feedback loops
- Use feedback for retraining or adjusting model thresholds

📌 **Activity**: Simulate model drift and use logs to flag an alert

---

### 🧰 **6. Tools & Platforms**

#### ✅ Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Docker**: containerize ML apps
- **Kubernetes**: scale apps and manage services in production
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, Azure for managed services

#### ✅ Application Interfaces
- **Streamlit**, **Gradio** for demos
- **Hugging Face Spaces** for public-facing prototypes

#### ✅ Model Lifecycle Tools
- **MLflow**, **W&B**, **TensorBoard** for experiment tracking
- **DVC**, **Git**, **GitHub Actions** for automation and versioning
